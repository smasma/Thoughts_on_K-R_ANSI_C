# Thoughts_on_K&R_ANSI_C
Contains thoughts and critique on K&R ANSI C. Beneficial for a refresher for seasoned pros as well as for newbies wanting to learn the greatest language on the face of Earth.

Over the last few decades, technology prevalence has brought too much focus on application software development and languages that are high-level, easy to learn and write code in. Python, Java, C++ (with all its criticisms) and other languages are prevalent. Universities start-off with Python or Java, which is great but things could be better.

Purpose here is to kind of re-introduce people to the real deal, C language, as the first language to learn and which can do amazing things both at the application and system level without saying that beneath most things lies the C language.

We look at K&R ANSI C and revisit main concepts here with the help of various other books available on C but which may be huge or too advanced for newbies.  

Have fun.
